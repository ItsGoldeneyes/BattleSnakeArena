# BattleSnakeArena
A modified, terminal based, battle snake arena to bypass servers and have complete access to data.

For the tests snakes, special thanks to:

Sajan Dinsa

Mitchell Nursey: https://github.com/mnursey/b-snake

These test snakes were modified to conform to requirements.

Just run the thing and download requirements till it works. It's ~300 lines of code, read it to figure out how it works. If there's any insterest I'll formalize this repository.
